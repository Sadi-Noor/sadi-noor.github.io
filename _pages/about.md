Hi : ^) [example](http://reddit.com). That's me to the side there, probably.

I removed the info box below my name because the font was gaudy(?) 

I found this useful method to link to any page, here's [the blog page](/blog/).

I can't link all of my social medias. You know, I actually Don't have any social media really, so ha.

Anyway, thank you for stopping by. It's A WIP!

Over the course of the next few units of time, I will be transforming this website into a nice little digital garden wherein I keep records of my professional, educational, and creative works. Of course, there will be overlap. This befits the blog being titled "commonplace." Stay tuned!
